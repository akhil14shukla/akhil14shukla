### Hey! I am Akhil

I am currently working on Time-Series Forecasting, my interest also lies in the field of Deep Learning and Classical Machine Learning. Along with ML/DL, I am also trying to focus on good development practices and software engineering.

In my current projects, I am comparing the performance of different models in Time-Series Forecasting and exploring a different way to forecast using Classical Machine Learning models and create a library for the same.

<!-- Python is good, but C++ is love. -->
